</div>
<div id="computing-platform" class="section level1">
<h1>Computing Platform</h1>
<p>The computing platform for STAT 223 is your own laptop computer, desktop computer, or a University-owned computer. If you do not have your own computer, please see James who can discuss options with you.</p>
</div>
<div id="git-for-homework-and-exams" class="section level1">
<h1>Git for Homework and Exams</h1>
<p>You will collaborate with James, the TA’s, and fellow students using <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>. Homework and exams will be managed through <a href="https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/44387582-byu-stat-223-fall-2018-term-2">GitHub classroom</a>.<br />
Each student will have their own personal repository for each assignment. The setup on your computer will happen in the first lecture. After the first lecture, please see the TAs or James during office hours if you need help.</p>
</div>
<div id="homework" class="section level1">
<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>Homework will be distributed on the course webpage and is due as indicated in the assignment and on the <a href="assignments.html">assignments</a> page. <strong>Your homework must be submitted via GitHub</strong>. This involves committing local changes and pushing to your repository on GitHub. Homework is not submitted if you do not successfully push to your GitHub repository when due. Homework may be turned in late at a 2 points per 24 hours penalty. Depending on the nature of the homework, it may be graded on correctness or effort. If homework is graded on effort, the following guide will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: Nothing submitted</li>
<li>5: Little effort is evident</li>
<li>8: Substantial effort is evident but it is not obvious that it is correct</li>
<li>10: Substantial effort is evident and it appears to be correct</li>
</ul>
<p>After your homework has been graded, a <code>feedback.txt</code> file will be added to your GitHub repsitory to provide specific feedback on your grade. You can view this file locally by performing a git pull.</p>
<p>Please note that solutions for homework assignments are not terribly difficult to find online. You are <em>strongly encouraged</em> to work through homework assignemnts without relying on copied answers from external sources as this will help you prepare for exams.</p>
</div>
<div id="in-class-exercises" class="section level1">
<h1>In Class Exercises</h1>
<p>Some class periods may include an in class exercise. You are welcome to take whatever notes you’d like to take in your notebook / on your laptop, then just write your final answers on your paper. You are responsible for bring your own blank paper for each exercise. You don’t need to show work for credit. The content of the exercise will not be graded — placing your name on a sheet of paper will get you credit for the quiz – but will be discussed in class. It is not uncommon for at least some in class exercises to form the foundation of exam questions. Your lowest exercise score will be dropped to compensate for misses due to illness and other unforeseen circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div id="exams" class="section level1">
<h1>Exams</h1>
<p>There will be a take-home midterm exam on a date to be announced later. The final exam will also be take-home. Exams are designed to assess a student’s mastery of concepts, skills, and connections between lecture and homework.</p>
</div>

<div id="honor-code" class="section level1">
<h1>Honor Code</h1>
<p>In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and every instructor’s expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 1-801-422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.</p>
</div>
<div id="sexual-misconduct" class="section level1">
<h1>Sexual Misconduct</h1>
<p>As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual harassment — including sexual violence — committed by or against students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of “Sexual Misconduct” prohibited by the university.</p>
<p>University policy requires any university employee in a teaching, managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of sexual misconduct that come to their attention through various forms including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you encounter sexual misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 1-801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at <a href="https://titleix.byu.edu/report" class="uri">https://titleix.byu.edu/report</a> or 1-888-238-1062 (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources available to you can be found at <a href="http://titleix.byu.edu" class="uri">http://titleix.byu.edu</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="student-disability" class="section level1">
<h1>Student Disability</h1>
<p>Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 1-801-422-2767. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified, documented disabilities. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and emotional concerns. Services are coordinated with the student and instructor by the UAC. If you need assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance policy and procedures by contacting the Equal Employment Office at 1-801-422-5895, D-285 ASB.</p>
